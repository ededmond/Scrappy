# Scrappy
A website that scrapes news articles from other sites and allows people to comment on them.
Going to the homepage will display new articles taken from TheOnion.com and display the blurbs along with some additional info. 

Clicking on "Save Article" will save the article to the database, and it can be accessed via the "Saved Articles" Link in the navigation bar at the top of the page. Only one copy of each article will be saved in the database.

On the "Saved Articles" Page, all articles currently in the database are displayed, with the most recently published article first. Anyone can delete any article by clicking the "Delete" button next to each article

Clicking "View Comments" will show all the comments for the selected article. Comments can be deleted by clicking the trash can, and anyone can make a new comment. (Users who don't leave a name will be listed as Anonymous).
